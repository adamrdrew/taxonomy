 - question: How do I install bonfire?
   answer: |
     Make sure you have pip installed, then run `pip install crc-bonfire`.
 - question: How do I prevent getting rate limited by Github when using bonfire?
   answer: |
     On Github create a personal access token on your GitHub account which grants bonfire read
     access to your repos. Then, configure bonfire to use the token with:
     `echo 'GITHUB_TOKEN=<your api token>' >> ~/.config/bonfire/env`
     Please note: When using the Github token (classic), it must have the read:project scope.
     In addition, since some projects may be private, you will need to add the repo (full control
     of private repositories) scope too. for the template fetching to work!
 - question: Can I use bonfire from a container rather than install locally?
   answer: |
    Yes! You can use the `quay.io/redhatinsights/bonfire` container image to run bonfire.
    `podman run -it --rm quay.io/cloudservices/bonfire`

 - question: How do I deploy a specific git ref for my app?
