 - question: What is inScope?
   answer: |
     inScope is the Red Hat Developer Portal. It is the single source you need to find everything related to Hybrid Cloud Console apps and services.
 - question: What kind of information can I find on inScope?
   answer: |
     Almost anything you need to know about Hybrid Cloud Console apps and services can be found on inScope.
     This includes links to docs, CI pipelines, github and gitlab repos, escalation metrics, SLIs, OpenShift delployments, security info, and a whole lot more!
 - question: What technology is inScope based on?
   answer: |
    inScope is a customized and opinionated deployment of Red Hat Developer Hub, which is itself based on Backstage, the open source developer portal framework.
 - question: What plugins are available on inScope?
   answer: |
     RHDH is plugin based, and inScope has a number of plugins enabled. These include plugins shipped with RHDH, ones we selected from the 
     community and adapted, and custom developed plugins. Some of these plugins include Visual Qontract, Jenkins, Tekton, OpenShift, 
     Kafka, Snyk, WebRCA, Progressive Delivery Topology, and a whole lot more. At the time of this training we deploy 64 plugins, but many of those 
     are core RHDH plugins internal to the system. We ship a bit more than 20 customized and configured plugins.
 - question: How can I add my project's documentation to inScope?
   answer: |
    There's a section in the user guide for that! You can find it at https://inscope.corp.redhat.com/docs/default/component/backstage-app/your_content/
    The short version is you need to have your docs stored in markdown in your repo and then add a YAML file to your repo that tells inScope where to find them.
 - question: How do I light up features for my app on inScope?
   answer: |
    You can enable additional features like Kafka Lag Metrics, Snyk integration, Ibutsu Tests, Jira Issues and moire by adding some simple labels to your
    app's metadata in app-interface. The user guide https://inscope.corp.redhat.com/docs/default/component/backstage-app/your_content/ explains how to set this up
 - question: How can I get help with inScope?
   answer: |
     You can check out the user guide here https://inscope.corp.redhat.com/docs/default/component/backstage-app/your_content/
     but if you need more help than that feel free to reach out to devprod on slack
 - question: What is the Catalog?
   answer: |
     It is where all of our ingested apps and services can be found. Go to the catalog to search for your app.
 - question: What is the difference between an app and a service entity?
   answer: |
     Apps are higher level entities that contain multiple services. They map directly to apps in app-interface. Services are the individual components that make up an app
     and map directly to code components in app-interface.
 - question: How can I see lag metrics for my kafka consumer groups?
   answer: |
     Go to the entity page for your app. The Kafka lag metrics, if your app is configured for them, will be on the front page.
 - question: How can I see my tekton deploy pipelines?
   answer: |
     Go to the entity page for your app. The Tekton pipelines will be on the front page. These also show up on your service pages under the CI tab.
 - question: How can I see my Jenkins pipelines?
   answer: |
     Go to the entity page for your app. The Jenkins pipelines will be on the front page. These also show up on your service pages under the CI tab.
 - question: How can I see my OpenShift deployments?
   answer: |
     Go to service entity page for your app. The OpenShift deployments will be on the OpenShift tab.
